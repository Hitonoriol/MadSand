	         #Stranger# Uhm... I haven't seen you here before, who are you?=>
	         #Stranger# Well, to be honest, it doesn't matter. Not in this place.=>
	         #Richard# My name is... uhm... Dick, but I don't really like it. Call me Richard.=>
	         #Richard# You seem lost... You know what? If you can prove you can be of any use, then we'll talk.=>
	         #Richard# Can you please bring me some wood for the campfire? Here's an axe, it'll help you.=>
	         #Richard# Return to me when you get 15 wood pieces.=>
	         * You can gather wood by taking axe in your hands (open inventory with E key and left click the axe), approaching a tree and hitting enter a few times.=>
	         * You can also interact with trees with your bare hands, then you'll get another kind of resource.

	         #Richard# Hm... Okay. You can take my axe as a reward. I didn't use it anyway. If you want some job or a good story, just ask!

	         #Richard# So, {PLAYER}, you liked using that axe, huh? [Uhh...]=>
	         #Richard# Guess what, I can show you how to make one yourself. You can even make other great tools that'll help you in this cruel world. [I'm interested]=>
	         #Richard# Well, let me remember... Ah! Bring me some small rocks. Maybe a dozen of them. You can find them near boulders. It won't be easy to gather them with your bare hands, but it's woth it, trust me!=>
	         * To gather small rocks, approach a boulder and interact with it.

	         #Richard# That's what I'm talking about! I'll take 5 of them, the rest is yours.=>
	         #Richard# So, to make a tool or really anything you can imagine you need to gather ingredients for it first.=>
	         #Richard# Or you can just buy a recipe from crafts master, but it's more fullfilling to figure out the recipe yourself, isn't it?=>
	         #Richard# Well, I did my part, you did yours. If you need something - just ask! Bye!=>
	         * To figure out a recipe, you need to gather some resources and open "craft" menu from inventory. If you find new resources that can be used in some recipe, a new entry will appear on the craft screen.=>
	         * For example, now that you gathered some sticks and small rocks, you unlocked a couple of new recipes. Go check them out.
